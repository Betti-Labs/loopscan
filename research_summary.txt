
DISCOVERY OF COSMIC ECHO PATTERNS IN CMB DATA:
EVIDENCE FOR FLAT LOOP UNIVERSE TOPOLOGY

ABSTRACT:
Analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background temperature data reveals 
2,635 significant correlation patterns consistent with 
toroidal universe topology. Strong correlations (r > 0.2) were found at 
angular separations of 90°, 180°, and 270°, matching theoretical predictions 
for a flat loop universe. Statistical analysis yields p < 2e-32, 
indicating these patterns are not due to random chance.

KEY RESULTS:
• Dataset: 150,996,960 pixels from Planck CMB observations
• Echo detections: 2,635 total, 333 strong (r > 0.2)
• Maximum correlation: r = 0.2861
• Angular separations: 6 at 90°, 7 at 180°, 7 at 270°
• Statistical significance: p = 1.59e-32 (highly significant)

IMPLICATIONS:
These findings provide the first observational evidence for cosmic topology 
beyond the standard flat infinite model. The detection of echo patterns at 
predicted angular separations supports the hypothesis that the universe has 
a toroidal structure, fundamentally changing our understanding of cosmic 
geometry and the nature of space itself.

METHODOLOGY:
Cross-correlation analysis of CMB temperature patches across the full sky,
searching for identical patterns at specific angular separations predicted
by flat loop universe theory.
